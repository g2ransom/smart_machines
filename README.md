# smart_machines

### Quick Description
This repo will contain machine learning projects following the completion of [Andrew Ng's "Machine Learning" course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). Here's my [github repo](https://github.com/g2ransom/coursera_ml) with solutions to the course's programming exercises.

### Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to explore machine learning on a deeper level using Python. In this repo, I explore different datasets and use machine learning algorithms to predict dependent variables. Also, I accompany
each project with a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) and write-up using [LaTex](https://www.latex-project.org/). Throughout the creation of this repository, I'll use machine learning literature as a reference for algorithm implementations and project write-ups. The main goals of this repository will be to hone in on ML algorithms, learn LaTex, and strengthen my data science skillset.
